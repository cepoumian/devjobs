## Overview

### The Challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for each page depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements throughout the site
- Filter jobs on the index page by title, location, and whether a job is for a full-time position
- Click a job from the index page to read more information and apply for the job
- **Bonus**: Experience the correct color scheme based on their computer preferences using `prefers-color-scheme` in CSS
